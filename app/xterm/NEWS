                            Patch #369 - 2021/09/21

     * modify  run-tic.sh  to  work  around  bug in development version of
       ncurses which was packaged in FreeBSD ports.
     * remove ifdef's for OPT_COLOR_RES and OPT_COLOR_RES2.
     * improve   performance  over  slow  connections  (report  by  Harald
       Dunkel).
     * update cursor if restoring mode for DECTCEM.
     * modify  CharWidth  macro to ensure that the shortcut for Latin-1 is
       only  applied  when  UTF-8 is not enabled, to fix a bug in handling
       soft-hyphen from patch #334 changes (patch by Martijn van Duren).
     * improve terminfo:
          + fill-in   function-keys  in  terminfo  which  are  not  Sun/HP
            keyboards using xterm+nopcfkeys building-block.
          + add kbeg to xterm+keypad to accommodate termcap applications
          + add  smglp and smgrp to vt420+lrmm, to provide useful data for
            the "tabs" +m option
     * support shift-tab in Sun, HP and SCO keyboards.
     * document some legacy features in ctlseqs.ms (prompted by discussion
       with Jimmy Aguilar Mena "Ergus").
     * add “trim” option to cdXtraScroll and tiXtraScroll.
     * remove support for non-fifo save-lines configuration.
     * extend  cdXtraScroll to check if the cursor is at the upper-left of
       the  scrolling  region when the erasure is for the remainder of the
       screen  versus  the whole screen (prompted by discussion with Jörg
       Breitbart).
     * add workaround for broken pcre2 package in Debian 10.
     * change  screen-refresh  call used for DECCARA and DECRARA to ensure
       that  trailing blanks which are part of the rectangle are repainted
       (report/analysis by Dennis Filder).
     * when  resetting  the terminal, ensure that the cursor shape also is
       reset,  e.g.,  if DECSCUSR has been used to modify the cursor shape
       for  an  xterm  which was started with the underlined cursor option
       (report/analysis by Luis Javier Merino).
     * prevent  DECSCUSR  from  blinking  the  cursor  if  the cursorBlink
       resource is “never” (report by Vladimir D Seleznev).
     * invert  the sense of DECSDM, to correspond with VT382 manuals (lsix
       #41).
     * update tables in wcwidth.c based on Unicode 14.0.0
